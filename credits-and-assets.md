# Assets
This engine uses assets from other mods. (If you disapprove of me using ANY of these assets, please tell me!)

- [**Psych Engine**](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine)
    - Alphabet.png and Alphabet.xml
- [**Funkin' Modding Plus**](https://github.com/FunkinModdingPlus/ModdingPlus)
    - I modified the "funkin alphabet" font they had so that it overflows glyphs properly. When exporting, it had [Rozebud](https://twitter.com/helpme_thebigt) on the credits. Just confused on who to credit tbh.

Think I forgot something? Tell me or smn lmao
